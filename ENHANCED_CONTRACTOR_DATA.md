## How It Works

### Agent Behavior

The Gemini Computer Use Agent now:

1. **Searches** for contractors in the specified zip code
2. **Browses** through top 3-5 contractor listings  
3. **Clicks into** each contractor's profile page
4. **Reads reviews** - both positive AND negative
5. **Extracts** specialties, pricing, experience, and badges
6. **Returns** comprehensive JSON data

### Increased Capability

- **maxSteps**: Increased from 20 to 35 to allow time for profile browsing
- **Detailed Instructions**: Agent specifically instructed to:
  - Click into contractor profiles
  - Read through multiple reviews to find both good and bad ones
  - Extract actual review text, not summaries
  - Look for "Top Pro" or "Elite" badges
  - Check if pricing is available or needs follow-up

## Notes

- **Agent Execution Time**: Browsing profiles takes longer (~35 steps vs 20), expect 2-3 minutes per platform
- **Review Quality**: Agent extracts actual review text, quality depends on what's available on the platform
- **Pricing Accuracy**: Some contractors don't list prices publicly - `priceNeedsFollowUp` flag indicates this
- **Specialties**: Extracted from contractor profiles, may vary by platform presentation
